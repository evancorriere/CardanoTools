# CardanoTools

CardanoTools is a set of scripts and tools I created while working on adaboys.io, a Cardano NFT project. 
The scripts allow a server running a relay node to automatically accept payment and send customers NFTs.
The scripts log mints in a database in order to ensure no NFT is minted twice and also has the ability to increase the price 
as more are minted. 

Please note that these scripts were ripped out of a larger project to be made available, so some renaming and redacting was done. 


Upcoming additions:
- Image generation scripts: tools to automate combination generation and Adobe Illustrator renderings
- Metadata processing scripts: tools to create and modify metadata files for each NFT

Feel free to use these scripts in your own projects.
